# Car Racing Speed Analysis

## Description
This project utilizes OpenCV to analyze video footage of car racing and calculate the speed of vehicles based on pixel distance. The application detects moving objects, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays the estimated speed in meters per second (m/s) on the video feed in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time detection of moving objects in a video.
- Speed calculation based on movement between consecutive frames.
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes and speed overlay.
- Easy to use with any video file by updating the path.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-racing-speed-analysis.git
   cd car-racing-speed-analysis

## Install required Python packages:

* pip install opencv-python numpy
